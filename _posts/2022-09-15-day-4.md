- title: Multilevel Bayesian quadrature
  abstract: "Multilevel Monte Carlo is a key tool for approximating integrals involving expensive scientific models. The idea is to use cheap approximations of the integrand to construct an estimator with improved accuracy over classical Monte Carlo. In this talk, we propose to further enhance multilevel Monte Carlo through Bayesian surrogate models of the integrand, focusing on GP models and the associated Bayesian quadrature estimators. We show through both theory and numerical experiments that our approach can lead to significant improvements in accuracy when the integrand is expensive and smooth, and when the dimensionality is small or moderate. We conclude the talk with a case study illustrating the potential impact of our method in landslide-generated tsunami modelling, where the cost of each integrand evaluation is typically too large for operational settings, but cheap approximations are widely available."
