- title: "Spectral kernels"
  abstract: The kernel choice defines the family of functions Gaussian processes model. In this talk we will consider spectral kernels: a framework to model arbitrary covariance functions in the spectral domain. These methods are particularly useful for modelling periodic data, or long-range correlations. Extensions to non-stationary kernels will be discussed as well.
